# What's coming in Broken Clock!

## Check out what we're working on!

It's been quite a while since we've shared development updates with you, both here and on our social media platforms. This blog post will address some of the projects we've been working on for some time now and about future updates.

<p style="margin: 0">We have a new <span style="font-weight: bold;">development team</span>, and we have plans for new content and projects for <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Broken Clock</span>. Here, we will also announce the future games that will be released in the coming months.</p>


## <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Adventures Of John and Mark</span>

This will be the game's biggest update so far, in which we will <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">change many things, add new ones, improve the gameplay, and rework some of the existing features in the game</span>. We know that many of you who have played and are playing the game are fascinated by delving into the game's story details. With that in mind, we decided <span style="font-weight: bold;">to focus this update on enriching and concentrating more on the game's main story</span>, with additional insights into the brothers' past.

First and foremost, we would like to thanks <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">forlornfellow</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">miliam05v1</span> for providing us with these incredible game covers for [The Adventures Of John And Mark](https://www.roblox.com/games/14108196267).

#### Please remember that everything mentioned here is <span style="font-weight: bold;">subject to change until the official update!</span>

We wanted to start by mentioning a rework of the lighting in some of the game scenes, giving them a more suspenseful and terrifying atmosphere, with distorted sound effects throughout the scenes.
In the nightmare scene, we made the game first-person to give the player a feeling of less security since they won't be able to see what's behind them.

<p style="margin: 6px 0 0 0"> Here are <span style="font-weight: bold;">some images</span> of the new nightmare area with the new lighting applied, giving it a darker and more ominous atmosphere.</p>

#### The forest and the basement door have never been so terrifying before!

#### A real nightmare is coming!
We've changed how the recording studio area in [The Adventures Of John And Mark](https://www.roblox.com/games/14108196267) works. Now, you <span style="font-weight: bold;">don't need to find the golden key to open the door</span>, or have to complete the parkour. Instead, you'll progress from door to door until you reach the final recording studio. Additionally, the Boss Fight will no longer take place in the nightmare.

## New features

### Daily rewards
<p style="margin: 0 0 8px 0;" >We've added a <span style="font-weight: bold;">daily reward system</span> so you can receive rewards for logging into the game every day.</p>
<img src="/images/blog/dev-blog1/image7.png" style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover; margin: 6px 0" alt="Some office">

## Reconnect
We've also added a <span style="font-weight: bold;">reconnect system</span> in case you drop from the game mid-match, allowing you to re-enter the same server you were playing on!

<p style="margin: 0 0 8px 0;" ><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> <span style="font-style: italic">You will only be able to reconnect to the server if there are players in it.</span> </p>

<img src="/images/blog/dev-blog1/image8.png" style="width: 60%; object-fit: cover; margin: 6px 0" alt="Some office">

## Friends Reward
Invite your friends to the game and <span style="font-weight: bold;">receive rewards</span> based on the number of friends who play with you.

<p style="margin: 0 0 8px 0;" ><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> <span style="font-style: italic">If you receive a reward, you won't be able to receive it again.</span> </p>

<p style="margin: 40px 0 0 0;" >There are still other systems we plan to add before the update, this is just a bit of what we've worked on so far.</p>

The update doesn't have a set date yet, but we aim <span style="font-weight: bold;">to release it as soon as possible in march</span>. We know it's an update that's taking a long time to come out, and we apologize for all the delay. We're putting a lot of care into this for you, and we hope you like what we're doing. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your support is very important to us!</span>

## <span style="text-decoration: underline">New Projects</span>

We mentioned in our [first blog](/blog/first-blog)  post that we had plans to start the development of our game Never Die in February, but due to some changes, we decided to postpone it, and for now, it won't have a release preview. However, with the new development team, we are planning to release a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Princess Castle Tycoon</span> game next month, and perhaps in the same month, launch our other game, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ball Chase</span>.
