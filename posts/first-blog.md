# First Blog

<h3 style>Welcome everyone to our first blog on the website!</h3>

We have many things to show and present some of our plans for this year, new projects and updates for existing games, such as [The Adventures Of John And Mark](https://www.roblox.com/games/14108196267). Regarding [Treacherous Tower](https://www.roblox.com/games/4237861040), we would like to clarify a few things about the future of the game.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">2023</span> was a year of big changes for <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Broken Clock</span>, on <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">October 7th</span> we had the release of [The Adventures Of John And Mark](https://www.roblox.com/games/14108196267) and the change of name of the group, which was previously known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">FunNetwork Studio</span>, this change was made due to the vision for the future of the group, we hope that we can continue to count on the support of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">all of you</span>.

We're really looking forward to this year, and we hope to continue having you with us, it means a lot to us!

<h3>Treacherous Tower</h3>

Some time ago we commented on [Treacherous Tower](https://www.roblox.com/games/4237861040), but now I'm more openly announcing that the game <span style="font-weight: bold;">will no longer have updates</span>, only <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">bug fixes</span>.

It was a very difficult decision for us, [Treacherous Tower](https://www.roblox.com/games/4237861040) was the most incredible thing that could have happened to us, and we just have to thank each and every one of you who made it possible and played it for all this time.<br/>
We recognize that, over the years, the game has gone through several phases, <span style="font-style: italic">some of which have not been entirely positive</span>. We have learned from our mistakes and aim, at some point, to reach or even surpass the impactful legacy left by [Treacherous Tower](https://www.roblox.com/games/4237861040).
